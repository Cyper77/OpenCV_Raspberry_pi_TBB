Inspiration from amazing tutorial from Adrian (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/10/09/optimizing-opencv-on-the-raspberry-pi/)

Inside this tutorial, there are three possible ways of optimizing OpenCV:

1. NEON 
2. VFPV3 
3. Threading Building Blocks¬©Ô∏è (TBB)

TBB is already successfully installed on my Rpi and made available precompiled [**here**](https://github.com/abhiTronix/TBB_Raspberry_pi)
. Hence i created this Latest pre-compiled set of binary: Pre-released & Stable OpenCV (4.0.0) compiled along with Latest (2018 Update 6) of TBB for the Raspberry Pi. It is made available in a ".deb" package and will save you countless hours not having to compile it yourself plus avoid worst looking compiling errors. This may or may not stay updated as I have to manually compile this version. I will try to make available most major versions. This is compiled for Raspberry Pi 3/2 Model B/B+ running Latest raspbian Stretch. This is enabled with TBB Support which helps multithreading in many OpenCV algorithms and significant [**3x~5x**](https://www.theimpossiblecode.com/blog/build-faster-opencv-raspberry-pi3/) increase in performance along with '**NEON**' and '**VFVP3**' support and other major compilation flags without _any whatsoever change in your program_.
For Files Look Down below.


## TBB ( Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks )
TBB is a library that helps you leverage multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading expert. It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanism for performance and scalability.

# Installation Instructions :
### (Tested on Raspberry pi 3 with Raspbian Stretch [Latest])
Simple (but straight forward):
  ```
sudo dpkg -i <path to *.deb file[e.g OpenCV_release_fp_tbb_armhf.deb]>
sudo ldconfig
  ```
# FilesüìÇ:
**Tryout Demo OpenCV(No TBB Supported) .deb file is available here:** [opencv_4.0.0-pre-demo_armhf.deb](https://github.com/abhiTronix/OpenCV_Raspberry_pi_TBB/blob/master/opencv_4.0.0-pre-demo_armhf.deb) (Refer Issue: [**#1**](https://github.com/abhiTronix/OpenCV_Raspberry_pi_TBB/issues/1#issue-391020295))   

***But if you want the latest & max optimized OpenCV([TBB + VFVP3 + NEON] Fully Supported) precompiled .deb files with installation support associated, it is only provided through email (*abhi.una12@gmail.com*)**. Also consider supporting my countless hours of hardwork and helping me out by making small *Donation for my ongoing Independent A.I. Research in return. Thankyou***
