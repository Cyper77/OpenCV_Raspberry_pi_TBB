Inspiration from amazing tutorial from Adrian (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/10/09/optimizing-opencv-on-the-raspberry-pi/)

Inside the tutorial, there is three possible ways of optimizing OpenCV:

1. NEON 
2. VFPV3 
3. Threading Building Blocks¬©Ô∏è (TBB)

TBB is already successfully installed on my Rpi and made available precompiled at  https://github.com/abhiTronix/TBB_Raspberry_pi
Hence i created this Latest pre-compiled binary of Pre-released OpenCV (4.0.0) & Stable OpenCV (3.4.2) compiled along with Latest (2018 Update 4) of TBB for the Raspberry Pi. It is made available in a ".deb" package and will save you countless hours not having to compile it yourself plus avoid worst looking compiling errors. This may or may not stay updated as I have to manually compile this version.  I will try to make available most major versions. This is compiled for Raspberry Pi 3/2 Model B/B+ running Latest raspbian Stretch. This is enabled with TBB Support which helps multithreading in many OpenCV algorithms and significant **3x~5x** (https://www.theimpossiblecode.com/blog/build-faster-opencv-raspberry-pi3/) increase in performance along with 'NEON' and 'VFVP3' support and other major compilation flags.

# TBB ( Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks )
TBB is a library that helps you leverage multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading expert. It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanism for performance and scalability.

2. **OpenCV (version: 4.0.0 pre) along with 'NEON' and 'VFVP3' Support enabled**.

# Installation Instructions :
## (Tested on Raspberry pi 3 with Raspbian Stretch [Latest])
Simple (but straight forward):
  ```
sudo dpkg -i <path to *deb file[e.g OpenCV_release_fp_tbb_armhf.deb]>
sudo ldconfig

  ```
